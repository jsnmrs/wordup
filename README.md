# Wordup

Convert Word documents to clean HTML or Markdown.

Wordup uses [CKEditor 4](https://ckeditor.com/) to do most of the cleaning. Additional formatting is applied to CKEditor&rsquo;s output. Markdown conversion handled by [Turndown](https://github.com/mixmark-io/turndown). Read the [Wordup blog post](https://jasonmorris.com/code/wordup/).
